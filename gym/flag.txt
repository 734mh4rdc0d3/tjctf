a combination of [1,2,3,4] 7 times is reqd to send to the binary.

pwn library is used for this purpose. if the end result doesnt contain the string "didn't reach my goal" then it could be the one.

a brute forcer of the combination is passed to the binary by creating a process and killing it if the output is not desired.
